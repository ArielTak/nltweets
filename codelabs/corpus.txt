b"@cyclelicious @prinzrob @alfred_twu @graue @sfmta_muni I think you're right, I spoke too soon. The SJ design keeps the width of the parking lane between the bike lane and the car lane, so the separation is probably about the same as in the Fremont design."

b'@AndrewKDavidson @FitzTheReporter @printtemps @theGreaterMarin @jonobate @GoldenGateBus @presidiosf @sfmta_muni @rachelswan IMO Marina Blvd should be road dieted to 2 traffic lanes with an optional 3rd left turn lane. Commuters can clog up Lombard or take a ferry or use bus on Lombard BRT lane.'
